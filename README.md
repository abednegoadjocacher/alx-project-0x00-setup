- ### Tasks
    1. __Scaffolding a project__: I created the project using the command '_npx create-next-app@latest alx-project-0x00 –-typescript_'
    2. __Setting up project directories__: I created the _components_ and the _interfaces_ directories.
    3. __Basic Routing__:In this project I used __Pages Router__ instead off __App Router__
    4. __Rendering Components__:I created a assets/images directory inside the public directory. I moved two images inside and rendered them inside my _landing.tsx file_.
    5. __Using components__: I used the _Card_ and _Pill_ components
    6. __Typing functional components__:I typed the components by assigning them a data type.
    7. __Advanced Task__:I created a button interface and defined it a component so I can reuse it.
